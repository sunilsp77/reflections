When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

when we want to share the work that we are doing.
when we want contributors to our project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

it is right that we pull changes manually.
bcoz sometimes we dont want changes done by other contributors to add to our version.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

branches refer to a single repository.
clones refer to copy repository from git hub to local system or in the local system.
fork refer to copy of repository on git hub.

when working on a local repository we use branches.
when copying repository from git hub to pc or copying on pc itself we use clone.
when copying repository from github to github on our account we use fork.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

the changes made on git hub by others can be updated by it.
then we can merge both the master and copy of the updated remote to avoid conflicts.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

It would be very difficult to collaborate without git or github.
we would have to collaborate manually.

using git and github would be easier and otherwise it would be very hard.
