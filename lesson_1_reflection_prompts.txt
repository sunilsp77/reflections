How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped me to find the bug very easily.
i can find out which lines are missing in new version.
i can find out which lines are added. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

It can increase efficiency of a programmer.
he can easily find out the bugs.
thus saves a lot of time.
use this time for any productive work.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

pros:
it saves memory by avoiding unnecessary commits.
we can save as per our requirements.
we can have smaller commits.
they are easier to read and maintain.
cons:
it may be tedious to create a commit manually.
smaller commits may make history difficult to read.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

 bcoz it might be easier to compare files simultaneously.
It is easy to track down the changes in multiple files in a single commit.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log command is used for viewing all the commits.
git diff is used to find differences between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

 bcoz we can easily undo any action at any time.
i don't need to worry about the changes to be introduced.
they can be undone at any time by checkout.



Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

for my long projects.
